# Weather App 

Weather App is an app where you can check the weather on all over the world. I am used free OpenWeather Api to fetch data.
Ð¢he application has the ability to find the user's location if he or the browser allows it. I am used navigator.geolocation.
The background is dynamic and depend from the weather condition.
